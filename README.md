# ❗⚠️ NOTE ⚠️❗

**This project is only made for the purpose of the video and isn't meant to be used on production.**

I put this on GitHub just so you can poke around with the application and try it out yourself. :)

## What's L33T Mario?

L33T Mario is a web game/application where you as Mario have to rescue the princess just like the classic but you play it by hacking. It's a vulnerable web game where you exploit several vulnerabilites to proceed through levels and eventually rescue the princess, each level getting harder and harder.

It's made for a YouTube video and to help **beginners** learn **Web Application Security** with a little nostalgia and fun.

## The Code

It's written in one night and I haven't even bothered to document or clean the code, just pushed it to master when it finally worked 😂! I mean you still can understand what's going on but playing the game is the main point.

I will work on cleaning & documenting the code later on when I add more levels/vulnerabilities to the game.

## How To Setup

Currently Linux is the only compatible operating system.

**Apache Setup:**

```bash
    $ cd /var/www/html/
    $ git clone https://github.com/mufeedvh/l33tmario.git

```
**Using Docker:**

```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/mufeedvh/l33tmario.git
    $ cd l33tmario/
    $ docker-compose up -d

```
